* Lattice Boltzmann Solver in C
** Overview
This program is an implementation of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods][Lattice Boltzmann Method
(LBM)]] in C. LBM is a technique for solving the Boltzmann equation
which can be used to model fluids. This implementation uses a D2Q9 model
with the BGK collision approximation and Zou-He boundary conditions.
** Installation and use
   1. The program uses standard libraries so no additional libraries
      should be required.
   2. Install using make ~make clean all~
   3. run with ~./bin/lbm~
   4. the residual history and final solution will be outputed to
      STDOUT. The final solution is formated as:
      |x|y|density|x velocity|y velocity|velocity magnitude|
   5. plot the answer using your prefered plotting software (see
      example below)
** Example
Below is the result of a lid-driven cavity flow simulation which was
found using this code. The left figure is plotted using Tecplot,
and the right figure is plotted using a terminal based plotting
software called [[https://github.com/conquerus/ncplot][NCPlot]].
